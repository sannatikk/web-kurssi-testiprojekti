# Intro to Web Applications: Course Project

## OAMK 3rd semester course (5 ECTS), specialization in Software Development

This website started out as just refreshing my HTML+CSS skills by building a simple portfolio, but somehow grew into my final course project. Since I wanted to keep the semi-respectable portfolio I had already built, I decided to add a special "Project Playground" web page for plain JavaScript sections, accessible through the hamburger menu. This Playground page contains the elements required in the grading criteria for the grade I aimed for which didn't really fit into a portfolio. (Like a slideshow of puffin photos or quotes from the BBC radio comedy Cabin Pressure.)

### Website location:

My website is currently live [here](https://sannatikk.github.io/web-kurssi-testiprojekti/)!
