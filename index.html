        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>In spring 2023, I made an impactful decision: I quit my comfortable job in the funeral industry and applied to study Information and Communications Technology (BEng).
        Now, I'm a second-year student majoring in Software Engineering, and I'm constantly amazed both at the software engineering field and how my previous skills have transferred!
        My goal is to work with SaaS, and I'm expecially interested in all things UX. My not-so-secret long-term ambition is to combine my core strengths and become a Product Owner!
        <br><br>When I'm not coding, I'm probably adventuring on my bike, knitting, or planning a trip to Norway to go birdwatching.

        <h2>My Work & Experience</h2>
        <p>Feel free to browse <a href="https://www.oamk.fi">my GitHub</a> repositories for examples of schoolwork I've been doing! I'm currently learning about web development, cloud services, and Java.
            <br><br>My favorite project so far has been <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/ATM_simulator_app">an ATM simulator</a>, where I got to practise building a Qt app, using Node.js, building and querying relational databases, and using RESTful APIs. 
            Fun extra credit challenges included hosting the database and backend remotely, using custom style sheets, and making the app ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
            <br><br>Another fun project was the Arduino-based game <a href="https://github.com/sannatikk/SpedenSpelit">"Speden Spelit"</a>, which features LEDs, buttons, and a 7-segment display. Pressing the start button initiates LEDs blinking in random order at a steadily increasing pace. 
            Players must press the gameplay buttons in the correct sequence to accumulate points, and the game ends if a mistake is made; the 7-segment display shows the score and signals if a new high score is achieved.
        <br><br>Some languages I've been using lately:
        <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Career</h4>
        In addition to schoolwork, I worked as assistant teacher in our "Introduction to Programming" course in spring 2024. 
        This role allowed me to help students learn programming basics, improve my teaching and communication skills, and gain insights into effective mentoring.

        <br><br>Ask me about my previous career in the funeral industry! Very few things teach you as much about customer experience, meticulousness, and working under pressure as working with grieving families.
